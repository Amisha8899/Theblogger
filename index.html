            <p class="post-description">Wikipedia defines a lifestyle as the way a
                 person lives. This includes patterns of social relations, 
                 consumption, entertainment, and dress. A lifestyle typically also 
                 reflects an individual's attitudes, values or worldview.  A glamorous 
                 lifestyle means you indulge in upscale, high-profile pursuits and 
                 live luxuriously.
